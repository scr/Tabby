# Tabby - the extension to make tabs more sane.
## Features
* New Tabs are inserted to the right of the selected tab.
* Pinned tabs are transported to the currently focused window.

## To do

* Closing the last unpinned tab should transport to the lower window
  (may need knowledge of window stack).
* Newly pinned and unpinned/closed tabs should be remembered too.
